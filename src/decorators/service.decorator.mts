/**
 * @fileoverview
 * This file contains the `@Service` decorator, which provides an API for
 * the registration of individual services (along with their dependencies).
 * Mainly, the Service function performs argument normalization, and then
 * passes the normalized metadata to the container.
 * The main service logic is hosted by the {@link ContainerInstance} class.
