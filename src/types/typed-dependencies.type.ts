/**
 * @fileoverview @ignore
 * The premise of this file is to allow for the conversion of service dependency lists into types which are appropriate
 * for consuming as part of the service's constructor.
 * 
 * The main focus of the implementation is below, in the `UnpackServiceDependency` type. This type transforms
 * dependencies into their actual values.
 *
 * For a constructor passed into `ServiceSubject`, an "expected type" is returned.
 * 
 * Consider the following example:
 * ```ts
 * @Service([AnotherService]) class MyService {}
 * ```
 *
 * In this case, as the `Service` overloads statically determines the class' dependencies,
 * it's able to create a type which it *expects* the constructor to be.
 * Considering the above example, the overload would expect the constructor it's going to 
 * operate on to be of type `new (arg1: AnotherService) => unknown`.
 * 
 * If the type doesn't match (so say the constructor implementation expects another 
 * type in that dependency's place), the code won't compile without using `any`.
 * 
 * Therefore, the following (thankfully) wouldn't compile:
 * ```ts
 * @Service([AnotherService])
 * class MyService {
 *   constructor (private value: number) { }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * If you look below, we also guard against built-in types surfacing into type design. For instance, if a class uses
 * Number as a dependency, the accompanying argument in the constructor would be `number` instead of the discouraged
 * `Number` type.
 * 
 * Consider the following example:
 * ```ts
 * @Service({ factory: () => new Car(2) }, [Number])
 * class Car {
 *   constructor (private modelNumber: number) { }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * Instead of using `Number` in the constructor, we're able to use `number` in its place. This is because, for each
 * dependency, we check if the type matches any of the built-in constructors, such as Number, String and Object. If they
 * do, they're cast to their underlying native types. In the case of Number such as in the above example, that type is
 * cast to `number`. The type compiler below is specially designed to accommodate this use-case.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * One note is that in the implementation, the expected type's return value is `unknown`. This is fine, as the return
 * types of decorators doesn't actually matter to TypeScript. This makes the implementation a little bit simpler.
 *
 * The advantage of this overall approach is that it mostly keeps the type-checking decoupled from the Service decorator
 * implementation.  The actual type-checking is performed in this file. Furthermore, we get type-checking basically for
 * free; this doesn't impact the size of the final bundle at all. Sweet!
 *
 * One notable drawback of this implementation is that, without modifications to TypeScript, we've absolutely no way to
 * force `Optional`-marked parameters to possibly expect a null type. In the case of our resolution constraint bitmask,
 * it's cast to a number internally. We can't check individual flags against it.

 * | **Object**     | `object`  |
