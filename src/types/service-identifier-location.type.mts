   * It could mean that the parent *does*, or that a container in the parent hierarchy

   * Here is an example where the direct parent of a container resolves the identifier:

   *
   * Container.set(NAME, 'Joanna');
   *
   * myContainer.getIdentifierLocation(NAME);

   * @example
   * Here is an example where a container in the hierarchy chain resolve the identifier:
   * ```ts
   * const NAME = new Token<string>();
   *
   * // Create a child of the default container, and then create a child of that.
   * const myContainer = Container
   *   .ofChild(Symbol())
   *   .ofChild(Symbol());
