   * As this is a semi-internal type which we cast objects to,
   * we have no control over the return type. Thus, the return
   * type of the dispose call could either be a promise or void.
   * In the case of a promise, it is generally expected that the
   * caller would await the process to settle before continuing
   * other operations or returning control to the host context.
