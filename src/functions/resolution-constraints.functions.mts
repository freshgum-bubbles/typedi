 *
 * @example
 * Here is an example of this constraint as part of a service declaration:
 * ```ts
 * const NAME = new Token<string>();
 *
 * @Service([
 *   [NAME, Optional()]
 * ])
 * class MyService {
 *   constructor (private name: string | null) {
 *     // If "NAME" isn't provided in the container the service is run under,
