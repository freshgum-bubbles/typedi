     * flag gets its own token, and that token is then added to an object which is stored in the
     * "multiServiceIds" Map, with the public identifier used as a key."
     *
     * To demonstrate this, let's provide an example:
     *
     * ```ts
     * const NAME = new Token<string>();
     *
     * Container.set({ id: NAME, multiple: true, value: 1 });
     * Container.set({ id: NAME, multiple: true, value: 2 });
     * ```
     *
     * *Internally, this code will result in the following:*
     *
     * The container checks if the identifier (which, in this case, is `NAME`) is present
     * in the {@link ContainerInstance.multiServiceIds} Map.  If it is not, an object is
     * created with the following properties:
     *
     * ```ts
     * interface ManyServicesMetadata {
     *   scope: ContainerScope;
     *   tokens: Token<unknown>[];
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * This object is then stored in the {@link Container.multiServiceIds} Map, with the key
     * being the identifier passed to {@link Container.set} by the user.  In the above example,
     * the identifier would be the `NAME` token.
     *
     * 1. The `scope` property is a {@link ContainerScope}.
     *    It tells {@link ContainerInstance.getManyOrDefault} how to resolve the identifier.
     * 2. The `tokens` property is explained below.
     *
     * For each call to {@link ContainerInstance.set} with `multiple: true`, a new {@link Token} is created.
     * This would then be passed to {@link ContainerInstance.set}, much like an ordinary call to set a new value.
     *
     * The new {@link Token} is then bound to a value.
     * In the case of the above example, the value is the number 1.
     *
     * Once the token has been bound, it is then added to the array of tokens
     * inside the {@link ManyServicesMetadata} object referenced above.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * In the presence of new features, this deceptively simplistic design has required some

     *
     * For example, in the case of the {@link ContainerTreeVisitor} API,
     * a flag ({@link ContainerInstance.isRetrievingPrivateToken} was required to prevent callers
     * being notified of the retrieval of anonymous tokens to retrieve values required by a call
     * to {@link ContainerInstance.getMany} (or its counterparts).
     *
     * Furthermore, this design has one implicit side-effect: the scope of all values associated
     * with a single identifier must be equal.  For example, you would not be able to set one
     * value as a singleton, and have another as a transient service -- in the current API,
     * this would not be possible.
