# Getting Started

Welcome to the TypeDI documentation! To get started, you'll need to ensure you have a working
environment containing Node and NPM (or any other package manager).

Then, you'll need to install TypeDI:

<NPMInstallBlock packageName="@freshgum/typedi" />

**You're done!** Move on to the [Hello World!](./examples/hello-world) example to learn how to use TypeDI.
