# Transient Services

Normally, when you create a service, it's cached and any further calls to `Container.get`
(or when the service is used as a dependency) result in the same instance of the service.

In some cases, that behaviour may actually be *undesirable*. For this use-case, TypeDI
provides *transient services*, which are re-instantiated every time they're requested.

:::tip

If your service performs complicated calculations, or emits side-effects (e.g. database connections), 
you may find that the performance of your application quickly deteriorates.

To fix this, you can "hoist" the logic outside of your transient service.
Read more about this in [the Performance section](#performance).

:::

## Demo

To demonstrate how transient services, let's create a simple example: a performance timing API.
The timing API should correspond with one set of marks alongside a final measurement.

```ts title="src/timer.service.ts"
import { Service } from '@freshgum/typedi';

@Service({ transient: true }, [ ])
export class TimerService {
    private name: string | null = null;

    start (name: string) {
        this.name = name;
        performance.mark(`${name}-start`);
    }

    end () {
        const endName = `${this.name}-end`;
        performance.mark(endName);
        performance.measure(this.name, `${this.name}-start`, endName);
    }
}
```

Now, we'll make use of this timing API in our page service,
a fictional service which is responsible for rendering pages.

```ts title="src/page.service.ts"
import { Service, HostContainer } from '@freshgum/typedi';
import { TransientRef } from '@freshgum/typedi/contrib/transient-ref';
import { TimerService } from './timer.service';

@Service([
    TransientRef(TimerService)
])
export class PageService {
    constructor (private timerServiceRef: TransientRef<TimerService>) { }

    async renderPage () {
        const timer = this.timerServiceRef.create();
        timer.start('page-render');
        // Perform page rendering logic...
        timer.end();
    }
}
```

Now, when a page is rendered, we'll have new performance entries to upload to a central diagnostics server.

## Transient Services as Dependencies

When you use a transient service as a dependency, the same instance of the service will
be used over the lifetime over the consuming service.  If this isn't the desired behaviour,
you would be better served by the `HostContainer()` API, which allows you to get an instance
of the container the service is running under.

Then, you can replace references to the transient service with calls to `Container.get`.

In the example above, we did just that.  This allowed us to get a new instance of `TimerService`
for each page that was rendered in the app.

## Performance

If your transient service relies on a great number of other transient services, computes expensive
computations, or creates side-effects which may affect the application, you may find that transient
services affect your application's performance.

For this reason, it's typically recommended to use static services or [singletons](./singletons) if
your workflow doesn't explicitly require services to be transient.

If you would still prefer transient scenarios in this case, consider **hoisting** calculations
and side-effects out of *individual* transient services, replacing them with references to a 
static / singleton service.
