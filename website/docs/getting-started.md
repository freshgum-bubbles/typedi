# Getting Started

Welcome to the TypeDI documentation! To get started, you'll need to ensure you have a working
environment containing Node and NPM (or any other package manager).

Then, you'll need to install TypeDI:

```sh
$ npm install @typed-inject/injector
```

__You're done!__ Move on to the [Hello World!](./examples/hello-world) example to learn how to use TypeDI.
